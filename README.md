# Scooby Doo Dataset Data Analysis/Walkthrough
This dataset contains various features such as different formats of Scooby Doo Programming (TV Episodes, Movies, Specials etc), Networks that showed Scooby Doo, their ratings, features within each episode that may influence ratings (special guests). With this in mind, we cleaned the dataset and focused on figuring out which Network aired the least positively acclaimed version of Scooby Doo and potentially why that may have been.
